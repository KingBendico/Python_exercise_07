# Python Exercise 07

## Exercise 1
1. Create a python module with a class called Webscraper that implements an init(self,URL) and functions that uses Selenium, BeautifulSoup and Regex needed to solve Exercise 2 (and 3). Furthermore, let the data be stored in class variables, so that results are easily accessed via objects. 

## Exercise 2
1. Import your module to your Jupyter notebook. 
2. Make an instance of your class with url: https://www.pricerunner.dk/cl/37/Grafikkort
3. Find graphics cards from Nvidia.
4. Find the most popular graphic processor (2080, 3070, etc.). 
5. Find all graphics cards with the given processor and store the result in a local dataset. 

## Exercise 3
1. Given the result from exercise 2, find the five cheapest cards across brands, and show them in a plot chart, with ‘name’ on the x-axis and ‘price’ on the y-axis.
2. For the cheapest card, find out which dealers are trading it, and what the average price is. (Hint: new search/webscrape)
3. Find the brand with the card that has the biggest difference in list price.
