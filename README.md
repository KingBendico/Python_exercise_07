# Python Exercise 07

## Exercise 1
1. Create a Python module with a class called Webscraper that implements an init(self,URL) and functions that use Selenium, BeautifulSoup and Regex needed to solve Exercise 2 (and 3). Furthermore, let the data be stored in class variables, so that results are easily accessed via objects. 

## Exercise 2
1. Import your module to your Jupyter notebook. 
2. Make an instance of your class with the following url: https://www.pricerunner.dk/cl/37/Grafikkort
3. Find graphics cards from Nvidia.
4. Find the most popular graphics processing unit (2080, 3070, etc.). 
5. Store the result in a local dataset. 

## Exercise 3
1. Given the result from exercise 2, find the five cheapest cards across brands, and show them in a plot chart, with ‘name’ on the x-axis and ‘price’ on the y-axis.
2. For the cheapest card, find out which dealers are trading it, and what the average price is. (Hint: new search/webscrape)
3. Find the brand with the GPU that has the biggest difference in list price.
